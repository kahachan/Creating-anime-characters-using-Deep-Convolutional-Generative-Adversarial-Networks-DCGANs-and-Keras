## Overview

Welcome to the "Creating Anime Characters using DCGANs and Keras" repository! This project is a mentee assignment from the IBM Advance AI program, building upon the completion of the "Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Document Using LLM" course from CognitiveClass.ai. In this project, we explore the fascinating world of generating anime characters using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) and the Keras library. DCGANs are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms that are particularly adept at generating images.

### Key Features

- **DCGAN Implementation**: Learn how to implement a DCGAN model using Keras, a high-level neural networks API.

- **Anime Character Generation**: Explore the process of generating unique anime characters using the trained DCGAN model.

- **Tech Stack Integration**: Gain insights into the technology stack utilized for image generation and manipulation.
